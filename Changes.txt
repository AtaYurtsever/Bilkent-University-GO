select has a problem sending arrays
when I try to send FenFakHavuz coordinates same as the one add it to  select
at the function onChange() somehow it changes its y coordinate sending it to the africa


Array [ 3645538.3292401824, -6469011.083723077 ]

Array [ 3645538.3292401824, 4846778.899146706 ]

above one is what you get when you choose fenFakHavuz on select
below sends to bilkent while top sends people to somewhere stupid
only difference is y coordinate of the FenfakHavuz button has 0s at the end which I think has no relevancy


...I quit for today
